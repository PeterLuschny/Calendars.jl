The package _Calendar_ provides a Julia implementation of 

- the Gregorian date, 
- the Julian date, 
- the Hebrew date, 
- the Islamic date, and 
- the ISO date.
## Notions and Conventions

A _day number_ `DN` is the number of days elapsed since the Gregorian date Sunday, December 31, 1 BC. Since there was no year 0, the year following 1 BC is 1 AD. Thus the day number of the Gregorian date `0001-01-01` is 1. The day number is sometimes also called _absolute date_.

The underlying calendar used is the _proleptic Gregorian calendar_, which is generated by extending the Gregorian rules backward to the dates preceding its official introduction.

Thus a _day number_ can be seen as a function associating an integer to a date: `DN : Y x M x D -> Z`, where `Z` denotes the integers. It measures the _distance_ of a given day to the epoch. To call a day number date is misleading and should be avoided. 

A _date_ is represented by a triple of integers `(year, month, day)`, and is basically the name given to a day by a calendar. We follow ISO 8601 for calendar date representations: year, followed by the month, then the day: `YYYY-MM-DD`. For example, `2022-07-12` represents the 12th of July 2022. This order is also used in the signature of the functions.

Thus a _calendar_ is a map, `calendar: DAY -> Y x M x D`, where a `DAY` is a strictly ordered set of twenty-four-hour time periods, and `Y`, `M`, `D` are finite sets of integers specified by the calendar together with an _epoch_, which is an instant in time chosen as the origin of the calendar, the first day of this calendar. 

We use the following acronyms for the names of calendars: 

- `CE` for _Current Epoch_ to denote proleptic Gregorian dates, 
- `AD` for _Anno Domini_ to denote Julian dates, and 
- `AM` for _Anno Mundi_ to denote Hebrew dates, and 
- `AH` for _Anno Hegirae_ for Islamic dates, 
- `ID` for _ISO Date_, an international standard date. 
 ## Example

For instance, the date of Mozart's birth is `1756-01-27`. The day number associated with this date is `641027` if we assume that the date is a Gregorian date. The Hebrew date of Mozart's birth is `5516-11-25`, and the associated day number is the same as the one associated with the Gregorian date.

Using our conventions we can write Mozart's birthday 
alternatively as

```
    - Current Epoch  CE 1756-01-27
    - Julian         AD 1756-01-16
    - Hebrew         AM 5516-11-25
    - Islamic        AH 1169-04-24
    - ISO Date       ID 1756-05-02    
    - Day Number     DN 641027
```

## Limitations

Currently, we do not support conversions for dates prior to the epoch of the respective calendar. The _invalid date_ `0000-00-00` (which has the _invalid day number_ `0`) is returned to either signal invalid input or a limitation of the methods.

## Basic Usage
